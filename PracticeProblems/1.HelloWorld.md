# Hello, World!

A good first challenge to do with esoteric programming languages is to create a Hello, World! program. Choose whatever language you want, and go for it! Some are easier than others, but all should be able to output a simple string of characters!

## Output
`Hello, World!`

### Extra Problem
Once you figure out the Hello, World! program, go ahead and try to optimize the program - make it as short as possible!
