# If Statement
A fun challenge to complete (especially on languages such as Brainf\*ck) is to create an `if statement`. The challenge is to figure out a way to create an if statement in a language like Brainf*ck. When you enter in a space, the program should output a `y`. If you enter anything but a space, the program will output `n`.

## Sample 1:
Input: `'p'`

Output: `n`

## Sample 2:
Input: `'2'`

Output: `n`

## Sample 3:
Input: `' '`

Output: `y`
